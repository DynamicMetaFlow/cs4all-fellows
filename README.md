# CS Curriculum Track 2017-18

## Deliverables for Summer 2017

We will discuss these goals and progress towards during our mandatory check-ins.

### Complete a prototype unit based on the projects you started last week
* Ensure the unit meets the CS4ALL criteria for meaningful CS units
* Ensure the unit is connected with a topic outside of the world of CS, another subject area, student interests, etc.

### Develop a plan to test your unit during the school year
* Testing with students - do you do the whole unit, part of it? when? how will you assess your success with curriculum design?
* Testing with other teachers - if you imagine other teachers trying your unit out, what do you need to get them there? how you will assess their success?

### Provide feedback on the elements of the CS4ALL Blueprint
* [Concepts](http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/concepts)
* [Practices](http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/practices)
* [Perspectives](http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/perspectives)
* [I Can Statements](http://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/ican)

### Per Session Hours
Fellows will be paid per session for all meetings with each other and CS4ALL staff as well as independent work done to develop, test, and evaluate CS units. Fellows are eligible for up to 10 hours of per session per month during the length of the fellowship if they are progressing towards fellowship goals.

## Kick-off workshop: Day 1

#### Soft-start
- Send an intro to the email if you haven't yet
- Read intro emails
- Read about [Erna Hoover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Schneider_Hoover) - What do telephones have to do with CS?
- Tell me about your expecations using the handout that says "As we scale CS4All across the City,..."

#### Understanding concepts and practices
For the next 30-45 minutes, please analyze [this tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) on React.js, Facebook's front-end rendering engine. Your goal is to find example of the [Concepts + Practices](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Oa9WgVrHA2TAWbT1b3_25M0VKyXJNUjduT_AhF_FZY) in the tutorial and to record them in the [Blueprint Scavenger Hunt spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJ8Pg0g8Ch3Vl5KisbfsaBv2zhriZgfWxksKhWoY-pg/copy)

Please share your Blueprint Scavenger Hunt spreadsheet with apatel4@strongschools.nyc.

#### Context
Why are we here? What is CS4ALL? What is the Blueprint?
Who are you? Who am I?
What is our goal?
What are our challenges?

#### Introduction to Meaningful Units
* What is computing good for?
    * Scale
        * Size
        * Distribution
    * Speed
    * Automation
* [What is a meaningful unit?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEulnD7j7qmECcX7zxsH_aGOPRiC-j-mE-0Q1Ak6dfs/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Design thinking to find opportunities to integrate CS

Create personas for:
* A teacher at your school who doesn’t currently teach CS
* A student at your school that doesn’t care about CS
* Resources
    - [What are personas?](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html)

Practical plans for the summer:
* Meetings (in-person, digital, small group, one-on-one)?
* What types of supports can I provide?

Independent work time:
* [Read existing units](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B30-P5ouHFE4c2VqSEcwNXV0M2c)
* Ask questions (listed below)
* Outline units

#### Homework

* Identify the artifact that you want students to make & start making it!


## Kick-off workshop: Day 2

#### Soft-start
* Share a project idea and post it on the wall
* Share an inspiring project
* Share a technical learning goal for yourself today - what do you need to learn to write/implement a unit

#### Context
* [How might I prepare to teach CS?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KB1WaqaNcFBb7ZHv3ABTIKkxCjBEmPHlrWEP5yZdmx8/edit?usp=sharing)
* PD leads workshop July 18-20 @ Downtown Conference Center, 9a-4p
* Time to build a project and document
    - 3 hour long sprints
    - 10 minute demos at the beginning of each sprint
    - 10 minute feedback session at the end of each sprint

#### Build Sprints
Potential demo topics
- Learning different programming languages
- Integrated Development Environments
- Version control with Github
- Documentation with screen capture

#### Reflection
Add discussion questions

#### Homework
* Keep building your project!
* [Read about the Teacher-Learner-Observer model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNXCm6MDcgqwwT32E56ZrTAvIFi5OW-ev9nE7CPU78M/edit?usp=sharing)

## Kick-off workshop: Day 3

#### Soft-start
* Sign for a demo slot with a post-it
* Keep working on your project + unit

#### Triage
Where is everyone in terms of having something worthwhile to demo that they can actually get useful feedback on?
Keep building...

#### Demos
Using the Teacher-Learner-Observer (TLO) training modality we will workshop our unit ideas, get useful feedback on content, pedagogical strategies, potential extensions, etc.

#### Next steps for Fellowship
Finalize meeting plan
Finalize objectives - dates and deliverables, per session management
